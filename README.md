# Understanding and Implementing LSTM from Scratch
This project presents a manual implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in NumPy to predict the future `(x, y)` coordinates of a vehicle over 5 time steps.
This implementation is built without the aid of deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or Pytorch, including training via Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and optimization using Adam.
